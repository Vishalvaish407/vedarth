(2, ' Hatha Yoga', '8 weeks', 'Hatha Yoga: Directing Your Energies\r\nTo lead you towards the experience of Yoga – of union and boundlessness – we manipulate the energy and move the system in a certain way. Physical postures are one aspect of this. Understanding the mechanics of the body, creating a certain atmosphere, and then using the body or body postures to drive your energy in specific directions is what Hatha Yoga or yogasanas are about. Hatha Yoga is not exercise. Asana means a posture. If I sit in one way, it is one asana. If I sit in another way, it is another asana. So innumerable asanas are possible. Out of these innumerable postures that the body can take, eighty-four fundamental postures have been identified as yogasanas.     Hatha Yoga is a preparatory process of Yoga. The word “ha” means sun, “ta” means moon. “Hatha” means the Yoga to bring balance between the sun and the moon in you, or the Pingala and Ida in you. You can explore Hatha Yoga in ways that take you beyond certain limitations, but fundamentally, it is a physical preparation – preparing the body for a higher possibility. There are other dimensions to this, but to put it simply, just by observing the way somebody is sitting, you almost know what is happening with them. If you have observed yourself, if you are angry, you will sit one way; if you are happy, you sit another way; if you are depressed, you sit yet another way. For every different level of consciousness or mental and emotional situation that you go through, your body naturally tends to take certain postures. The converse of this is the science of asanas. If you consciously get your body into different postures, you can also elevate your consciousness.', 900, NULL, '2021-05-05 09:34:35'),
(3, 'Astanga  yoga ', '12 weeks', 'In Sanskrit \"Ashta + anga\" is ashtanga. \"Ashta\" means Eight and \"Anga\" is limbs so it means Eight Limb path, Ashtanga yoga is based on Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali. The asanas, Pranayamas or the dharana which we have studied earlier or the yam and niyam are based on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Hence, we will acquaint ourselves with the fundamentals as stated by Patanjali first.        Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga is a style of yoga as exercise popularised by K. Pattabhi Jois during the 20th century, often promoted as a modern-day form of classical Indian yoga. He claimed to have learnt the system from his teacher, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya.

(4, 'Meditation', '2-3 weeks', 'Meditation is often defined as thinking continuously about one object of thought. We often get stuck on this definition, however, and lose the real purpose of meditation. Meditation must reveal the true nature of that object upon which we are meditating. Such revelation comes not as a thought, but as a feeling. Therefore, meditation is a process in which we shift from thinking to feeling. It is a journey from the complexity of mind to the simplicity of heart. It is for this reason that most methods of meditation involve the heart.\r\n\r\nThough we can easily remember an image or an idea, it is difficult to recollect a feeling.    Have you ever tried to recollect the taste of a meal you had many years back? You may vividly remember the place where you ate. You may even remember its ambience, but the actual taste of the food can never be retrieved. Why? It is because feeling is always in the present, in the now. Therefore, we cannot be happy with the feeling of a good meditation from eons back. Of course, the memory of a great revelation in meditation is good, but it is akin to someone who hits the jackpot once in his lifetime and is a beggar for evermore. The feeling we derive in meditation must become a permanent affair.\r\n\r\nYet, even feeling has its limitation. The heart is never truly satisfied with feeling. At some point, feeling becomes a burden, whether it is the feeling of pleasure, of joy, or even of bliss. Feelings are difficult to handle. In true meditation, we enter into absolute nothingness, a complete void of experience.\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, '2021-05-05 09:52:36'),
(5, 'Pranayama', '2-3 weeks', 'Pranayama\r\nWe talked about the definition of Pranayama and Pran-sakthi in the previous article In this article, we will talk about the types of Pranayama, the procedure to practice Pranayama and of course, the benefits.\r\n\r\nPranayama is a scientific method of breathing. Take deep and long breaths through the nose. Before starting Pranayama, one should take 5 to 6 long and deep breaths through nose in order to relax the material body.\r\n\r\nExhalation or (Rechaka)\r\n\r\nWhile exhaling, the abdominal muscles help to evacuate the lungs by raising the diaphragm. Greater volume of fresh air should enter the lungs. Unless we first breathe out fully, it is impossible to breath in correctly.\r\n\r\nInhalation (Puraka)\r\n\r\nHaving emptied the lungs, the next step is to fill them up to the maximum possible extent. The total volume of air which the lungs are able to contain is known as the vital capacity, which is about six liters. Before one can contemplate to increase this capacity, full use must be made of what is already available. Scientific breathing enables the practitioner to do this.\r\n\r\nAdequate supply of oxygen is essential for the proper functioning and vitality of the cells. It is therefore, vitally important to breath correctly so that every cell can receive oxygen.\r\n\r\nBreath Retention(Kumbhaka)\r\n\r\nHolding breath, systematically, both before inhalation and exhalation is called Kumbhaka. Before exhaling, holding the breath for few seconds is known as Antara Kumbhaka and before inhaling, holding the breath for few seconds is knows as Bahaya Kumbhaka.\r\n\r\nThe practice of breath hold out in midst of Pranayama enables the increase of heat in the body and thereby longevity. It also enables increase of concentration beside physical and mental power. Kumbhaka should not be practiced by those below 15-16 years of age and those suffering from hypertension, heart diseases, asthma and ulcer.\r\n\r\nSimple Pranayama\r\n\r\nNaadi Shudhi-purification of subtle perception paths\r\nSit erect in Padmasana or any other meditative posture exhaling completely.\r\nRight hand’s thumb must be lightly placed on the right nostril. Take long, deep and steady breaths from the left nostril. Feel that breath is passing into you.\r\nNow place the right hand ring finger on left nostril. Lift up the right thumb from right nostril and empty out the breath. Make a round, intake from left and breathe out from the right nostril.\r\nInhalation and exhalation should be of same duration. Combine Kumbhaka with this in the ratio of 1:4:2. If you inhale in four seconds, retain the breath for 16 seconds and then exhale in 8 seconds. The above can always be improved with more and more practice.\r\nInitially, 5 to 9 rounds is recommended, but after more practice, one can go upto 20 to 25 rounds daily.\r\nEarly morning and late evenings are good time for the above practice.\r\nThe benefits of above practice may be seen in 4 to 6 months time. This leads to purification of Nadi’s. There are supposed to be 7.2 million nadi’s in the body. This is very beneficial before sitting in meditation as it helps to improve concentration. It also lightens the body, improves brightness of eyes, and digestion system. It helps to reduce hypertension and anxieties.', NULL, NULL, '2021-05-05 09:54:26'),
(6, 'Yin Yoga', '4 weeks', 'While “yang” yoga focuses on your muscles, yin yoga targets your deep connective tissues, like your fascia, ligaments, joints, and bones. It’s slower and more meditative, giving you space to turn inward and tune into both your mind and the physical sensations of your body. Because you’re holding poses for a longer period of time than you would in other traditional types of yoga, yin yoga helps you stretch and lengthen those rarely-used tissues while also teaching you how to breathe through discomfort and sit with your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe practice of yin yoga is based on ancient Chinese philosophies and Taoist principles which believe there are pathways of Qi (energy) that run through our bodies. By stretching and deepening into poses, we’re opening up any blockages and releasing that energy to flow freely.\r\n\r\n\"A yin yoga sequence has a very similar effect on our energies as an acupuncture treatment,\" yin yoga instructor Stefanie Arend previously tells mbg. By holding the various poses, a yin yoga sequence can help restore the healthy flow of Qi in our bodies.\r\n\r\nHere, the goal isn’t to move through postures freely--postures could be held for three to five minutes, or even 20 minutes at a time. A yin practitioner is trying to access the deeper tissues, and many of the postures focus on areas that encompass a joint (such as the hips, sacrum, and spine, to name a few).

(7, 'Power Yoga', '8 weeks', 'As the name suggests, power yoga is focused on building strength and endurance. It is also an excellent form of yoga for burning calories.\r\n\r\nAlthough power yoga isn’t an official type of yoga, the term is sometimes used interchangeably with Vinyasa yoga. It’s probably more accurate to say that power yoga is a form of Vinyasa, which has its roots in Ashtanga yoga, an established practice that began in the early 20th century.\r\n\r\nWith power yoga, the emphasis is on the flow from one pose to the next, rather than approaching each pose separately. The poses aren’t disconnected from each other, unlike some other forms of yoga.\r\n\r\nNo matter what you call it, power yoga is a fast-paced and intense activity. You move from one posture to another rapidly, linking your breathing to the different motions of your body.\r\n\r\nA power yoga class may seem more like an aerobics class than a relaxed, mindful yoga experience. Though it requires mindfulness and focus on your breathing, power yoga is more dynamic than meditative.     What are the benefits?\r\nAccording to scientific evidence, power yoga provides a wide range of both mental and physical benefits. Here’s a look at some of the key benefits of this fast-flowing yoga style.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular health\r\nBecause of the fast pace and resistance training involved, researchTrusted Source shows that power yoga workouts can raise and sustain your heart rate.\r\n\r\nGetting your heart rate up during exercise helps your body circulate blood and oxygen to your muscles and organs more efficiently. This, in turn, can help improve your fitness, stamina, and overall health.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, regular cardiovascular exercise, like power yoga, can benefit you by:\r\n\r\nstrengthening your heart and lungs\r\nhelping control high blood pressure\r\nimproving cholesterol levels\r\ncontrolling blood sugar levels\r\nbuilding stronger bones and muscles\r\nhelping with weight loss\r\nimproving sleep\r\nboosting energy levels\r\nimproving brain function\r\nlowering your risk for chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, and diabetesHow to get started\r\nPower yoga classes are typically taught at fitness centers or yoga studios. When starting out, look for beginner or introductory classes, and ask your friends or co-workers for recommendations.\r\n\r\nYou may not see classes listed as “power yoga” courses, but instead they may be called Vinyasa yoga classes.\r\n\r\nBefore signing up, talk with the instructor or people working at the fitness center or studio to learn more about the power yoga class and what it includes. Also find out what level of expertise or fitness is needed for the class.\r\n\r\nIf you’re new to yoga, you may want to consider an introductory class in Hatha yoga. This can help familiarize you with a variety of yoga poses and how to do them correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to practice power yoga on your own at home, there are many online videos you can stream and follow along. You may also want to try out a yoga app that you can download to your phone or tablet.\r\n\r\nIf you have a chronic condition such as heart disease or arthritis, have an injury, or you are pregnant, check with your doctor about whether power yoga is safe for you.\r\n\r\n', NULL, NULL, '2021-05-05 09:56:42');
